# MC - Portfolio Optimization

Let's start investing! Should I invest in a portfolio of companies or S&P500 ?
Steps:
- 1) Find the best stocks to buy from the U.S. market
- 2) Compare those selected companies to stock indices, and filter companies with high return rate  
- 3) Check correlation of returns to mitigate volatility and risk
- 4) Estimate Sharpe Ratio & CAPM
- 5) Randomly assign weights to our stocks in the 10,000 portfolios, then calculate the means of daily returns and volatilities of the returns
- 6) We select the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio rate to invest
